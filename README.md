# Reaction Base - A base Docker image for Reaction Commerce

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/reactioncommerce/base/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/reactioncommerce/base/tree/master)

With the release of Meteor 1.7, we changed the versioning of this repo and it's Docker builds to align with Meteor's release. Henceforth, releases in this repo will be tied to the corresponding Meteor release.

Sample version builds:

| reactioncommerce/base version       | Meteor version  |
| :----------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| v1.7.0.1-meteor                     | v1.7.0.1        |
| v1.7-meteor                         | v1.7            |
| v1.6.1-meteor                       | v1.6.1          |
| v4.0.2                              | v1.6.1          |

See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/base/tags/) for full list.

### Usage

Add the following to a `Dockerfile` in the root of your Reaction Commerce project:

```Dockerfile
FROM reactioncommerce/base:v1.7.0.1-meteor
```

Then you can build the image with this command (after setting your version):

```sh
VERSION=
docker build \
  --build-arg TOOL_NODE_FLAGS="--max-old-space-size=4096" \
  -t reactioncommerce/reaction:${VERSION} .
```

Note: Depending on the type of OS running the build, `--max-old-space-size` may require a different value (e.g 2048). See explanation of the Meteor issue [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/8513).

See Reaction's sample Dockerfile using the base image [here](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/Dockerfile).

### Run

Use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the app. A demo [docker-compose file](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/docker-compose-demo.yml) is included in the Reaction repo.

Run this command to start the app:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-demo.yml up
```
